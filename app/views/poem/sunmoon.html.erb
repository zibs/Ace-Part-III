		These two poems, which collate every usage of ‘moon’ and ‘sun’ as a prefix the OED acknowledges, are partially intended to be sound poems which make use of intense repetition to induce a sonic drone akin to religious incantation. However, their respective content also reflects the ubiquity of the sun and moon in our quotidian argot; many of these phrases are still heard today, even if their intial usage dates back hundreds of years. These poems are archival records of how language is indelibly born from our environment; the frequency of the moon/sun as prefix - their ostensibly inexhaustible linguistic inspiration - should then be unsurprising considering the fidelity of these celestial bodies in diachronic relation to the evolution of English.
