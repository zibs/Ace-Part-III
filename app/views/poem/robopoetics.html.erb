		<p>Recent, poetic trends suggest that, in order to avoid sounding completely outdated, many poets may have to learn a new catechism, acquiring competence in domains far beyond the purview of literary expertise. Poets may have to become advanced typesetters and computer programmers - technicians, polyglot in a variety of machinic dialects: HTML and Quark, PERL and Flash. Poets may have to learn the exotic jargon of scientific discourses just to make use of a socially relevant lexicon, and now that cybernetics has effectively discredited the romantic paradigm of inspiration, poets may have to take refuge in a new set of aesthetic metaphors for the unconscious, adapting themselves to the mechanical procedures of automatic writing, aleatoric writing, and mannerist writing - poetry that no longer expresses our attitudes so much as it processes our databanks.</p>

		<p>We may exalt the poets of the future, not because they can write great poems, but because they can program devices that can write great poems for us, doing so automatically within a digital economy of unrestricted expenditure. We may also want to keep in mind too that we are probably the first generation of poets who can reasonably expect to write poetry for inhuman readers, be they aliens, robots, or clones. </p>

		<p>While automating the collection of content is partly a matter of
convenience (it could have shaved a few years off the writing of Christian
Bök’s Eunoia, for example), the result of this action is a startling shift in
the status of the text. As the collection process becomes increasingly automated,
the collection program — rather than the output — becomes the
poem.</p>

		<p>Meaning and meter alone do not account for its effect. How does language have to be constituted for the poem to cast its spell? What order of discourse, what mechanisms of speech production, what rituals of language acquisition have to be in place in order to lure the wanderer and his readers into an “audible twilight” in which trees and mountains are brimming with soothing messages and in which even the absence of bird chatter is full of spiritual sig- nificance? Kittler is less interested in what the poem is saying than in uncovering the mechanisms that produce meaning in the first place.</p>

		<pre>Literary theory can be described as the application of philosophical, political, and psycho-analytical principles or methods to the study of literary or cultural works. Theory suggests a predilection for consistency and explanation, and like philosophy may take the form of stand-alone argument. Poetics in contrast, is provisional, context-dependent, and often contentious. Theory will commonly take a scientific tone. Poetics will sometimes go out of its way to seem implausible, to exaggerate, or even to be self-deprecating. Since <em>this</em> is a work of poetics, I won't note that poetics can also take a form directly opposite to what I am proposing. Like politics, poetics is plural.

		<pre>Scholarship requires poetics. Paratactic writing - thinking by association - is no less cogent or persuasive than hypotactic exposition, with its demands that one thought be subordinated to the next. Poetics reminds us that the alternative logics of poetry are not suited just for emotion or irrational expression - poetics lies at the foundation of all writing...The importance of poetics for scholarship is not to decree that <em>anything goes</em>, but rather to insist that exposition is an insufficient guarantor of reason. Poetics makes scholarly writing harder, not easier. It complicates scholarship with an insistence that way we write is never neutral, never self-evident. Clarity in writing is a rhetorical effect, not a natural fact.
