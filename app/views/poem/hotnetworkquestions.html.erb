	<p>Ron Silliman's classic <a href="http://www.ubu.com/ubu/pdf/silliman_sunset.pdf"><b>Sunset Debris</b></a> consists of 1873 questions. This poem participates in the now <em>cliché</em> intertextual engagement of his poem. However, the source material for this poem comes from <a href="http://stackexchange.com/questions?tab=hot"><b>stackexchange</b></a> which describes itself as "a network of 148 communities that are created and run by experts and enthusiasts like you". Each of these communities "build libraries of high-quality questions and answers, focused on each community's area of expertise". These are the spectacular, complex, unexpected, and often uncannily Sillimanian questions this poem collects. It will end after it collects 1874 questions.</p>
