	<p>Uhh..oh boy. Well first imagine that two great German writers and thinkers, the poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke"><b>Rainer Maria Rilke</b></a> and the literary scholar and media theorist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kittler"><b>Friedrich Kittler</b></a> became fused together into a type of cyborg entity, and then decided to poorly emblematize this coalescence by having the former entity Rilke's famed <em>Duino Elegies</em> be translated and transformed by computer technologies into a palimpsest that at once points both to the ephemeral nature and "transience" of reality, but also to  the "excess" or "superabundance" of alphanumeric code we translate daily. Maybe.</p>
